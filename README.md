# JuliApp
Android app that i made for my girlfriend, when you open the app it will show a qr scanner that only works with the qr codes that i created in an API, when the qrcode is scanned it will fetch an API for a image and a text, when the information is retreived it will show a "card" that has a photo of me and my girlfriend and when you swipe the image, it will display a text of my choice.
